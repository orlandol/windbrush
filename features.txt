Feature Plans for Windbrush
[Updated: 2019-10-17]

- User interface taking up about 20% of the screen at most.
- Layout optimization for Portrait and Landscape screen modes.
- UI components open on click or hover, and optionally stay open
  if locked. Goal of 2 clicks maximum for any available action.
- Hotkeys to open and auto-lock appropriate UI components.
- HSV/HSB color selector with optional numeric input.
  Shape of selector is TBD, but likely based on a Triangle.
- Color Harmony guide to choose complementary/etc colors.
- Complementary Color mode in color selector shows inverted shapes
  with colors. Optional auto-selection of complementary color.
- Color mixer where resulting color is surrounded by X number
  of colors, optionally enabled by clicking between both.
- Mix amount determined with slider in between resulting
  color and color component.
- Pixel displacement tool, where a line is sized and/or rotated,
  allowing for pixels to be divided/moved around.
- Easy to use animation interface where frames can be dragged
  and dropped around.
- Fast scrolling using supplementary devices, such as the
  Leap Motion. Intended to ease working with large images.
- Drawing tablet support, with auto-eraser detection.
- Consistent and optional pixel grid.
- Zoomed pixel editing mode for either the entire work area,
  or through a selected area using a zoom lens.
- Pre-selected zoom presets for fast cycling between desired
  zoom amounts using the mouse wheel or equivalent.
- Optional auto-detection of handedness, adjusting UI for
  right/left handedness.
- Animation preview showing current frame regular sized, previous
  2 frames scaled above, and next 2 frames scaled below.
- Dynamic floating color palette allowing colors to be added to
  either side, in any desired shape, grouped by the artist.
- Provide only necessary program options, making intelligent design
  decisions wherever possible.
- Human proportions grid with customizable dimensions. Guide for
  fat deposits/etc to assist with variations in body type.
- Draw over guide for 3-D models, such as mannequins, planned for
  later releases.
- Pixel extruder tool to "raise" selected pixels.
- Scanner support planned as a draw over guide layer.
- Sprite Sheet editing with drag and drop re-arrangement.
- Pixel mask support for more precise editing.
- Silhouette preview mode.
- Color blind preview mode.
- Optional enabling of ASMR style brush strokes for
  audio feedback (TBD).
- Guided pixel tool which attempts to draw clean lines based on
  the current pixel position. May also use direction prediction.
- Built-in pixel drawing tutorial, based on Windbrush's
  features/capabilities.
- Image offsetting to edit seamless tiles, etc.
- Perspective snap tool in which the start point is chosen, then
  the end point snaps to the perspective by the perspective point
  whose zone the starting point is in.
